## About me
I’m a graduate student focused on building scalable software systems and applied AI solutions. Before my MS, I worked at a telecommunications startup where I supported backend services across payments, messaging/notifications, and AI-assisted call workflows—modernizing legacy systems and contributing to production-grade integrations using LLMs and speech-to-text.

## Current work (IU)
**Natural Language Processing Lab (Volunteer Research Project) | Sep 2025 – Present**  
- Annotating and analyzing Twitter data to support training and evaluation of drug-related NLP classifiers  
- Curating and normalizing drug terminology and slang to expand a NIDA-based knowledge graph for NLP pipelines

---

## Experience highlights
- Backend development with **Python + Flask** (internal APIs), **JavaScript**, and Linux-based services  
- Modernized legacy systems and improved reliability/performance in communication and payments workflows  
- Contributed to AI features using **GPT** for summarization and **Whisper** for multilingual speech-to-text  
- Worked with operational workflows and automation (including **Apache Airflow** in backend services)
